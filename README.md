# Online-Examination
A online examination portal through which a user can login and choose the subject from the list and start his/her test.
A user first has to signup/login to see the avilable subjects and then only he/she can start his/her test. 
Its more like a practice test. 
Pros:-
1. Everytime a user want to reset the password a email will be sent to the user with a link and then only he/she can reset the password
2. Proper validation for the email and the available username.

Cons:-
1. I have tested it only on the localhost.
2. A very basic look and feel. Not many fancy effects.
3. Less number of question and subject till

For the email sending you have to add your email and password in "forget2.php" and "sign_up2.php" file, for the proper working of email.
You have to add the email unless it will not work.
The email id must be a gmail account.
"You have to change the 'Allow Less Secure Apps' setting to ON for allowing the php mailer to send the emails".
